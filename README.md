# üìê GCD Calculator using FSM and Datapath Design

This project implements a **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** calculator in Verilog, showcasing **two different approaches** to solving the same mathematical problem. The project emphasizes **digital hardware design principles** by comparing:

1. A **behavioral Verilog model** using `while` loop and modulus (`%`) operator  
2. A **fully synthesizable FSM + Datapath architecture** using the subtraction-based Euclidean algorithm

While both approaches are functionally correct, this project is primarily built around the **FSM + Datapath design**, which mirrors the internal workings of a CPU and is suitable for **actual hardware implementation**.

---

## üß† Project Overview

The main learning goal of this project was to explore the **controller + datapath design pattern**, which is foundational in modern CPU architecture. The FSM handles sequencing and logic control, while the datapath performs the arithmetic operations.

Additionally, an alternate Verilog implementation using a `while` loop and `%` modulus operator is included to compare both **hardware feasibility** and **performance considerations**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Design Approaches

### üîß Approach 1: Behavioral Verilog using `while` + `%` (Simulation Only)

This model follows the traditional GCD approach taught in programming courses ‚Äî repeatedly applying modulus until one operand becomes zero.

```verilog
while (a != 0 && b != 0) {
    if (a > b)
        a = a % b;
    else
        b = b % a;
}
gcd = (a == 0) ? b : a;
```

- ‚úÖ Functional in simulation  
- ‚ùå Not synthesizable  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses `%` operator and `while` loop, which do not map directly to logic gates  
- üìÇ Module: `GCD_while.v`, `GCD_while_tb.v`

This version is helpful for **early-stage functional validation**, but not suitable for synthesis or FPGA/ASIC design.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Approach 2: FSM + Datapath using Subtraction (Synthesizable)

This is the core of the project. It builds a **hardware-friendly GCD unit** by breaking the design into:

- **Datapath**:
  - Subtractor
  - Comparator
  - Registers (PIPO)
  - MUXes  
- **Controller FSM**:
  - Issues control signals (`lda`, `ldb`, `sel1`, `sel2`, `sel3`)
  - Monitors condition flags (`Lt`, `Gt`, `Et`)
  - Determines which operand to update each cycle

This architecture mimics **how processors execute arithmetic through datapaths and control units**, making it an excellent exercise in **VLSI and digital system design**.

## üîÅ Why I Chose the FSM-Based Subtraction Approach

While both methods compute the GCD correctly, the final design was centered around the subtraction method for **hardware feasibility**:

| Feature | Subtraction Method | Modulus Method |
|--------|--------------------|----------------|
| Synthesizable | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Hardware Resource Cost | Low (simple subtractor) | High (requires division circuitry) |
| Performance | Faster in hardware | Slower due to modulo complexity |
| Suitability | Excellent for FSM control | Best for simulation only |
| Final Choice | ‚úÖ Chosen | ‚ùå Rejected for synthesis |

In digital hardware, **modulus (`%`) is slower and resource-heavy** compared to subtraction. Since both approaches require repetitive operations until convergence, the **subtraction method is computationally more efficient in a circuit**. Subtraction is just an adder with inversion and carry-in, while modulus requires division hardware or iterative logic, making it costlier and slower.

Thus, I opted to go with the **FSM + Datapath design** and treated the behavioral model as a learning milestone rather than the final implementation.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project demonstrates two distinct ways to compute GCD in Verilog ‚Äî one focused on **hardware synthesis** and the other on **algorithmic clarity**:

- The FSM-based subtraction model is **modular, synthesizable**, and suited for real hardware.  
- The while + modulus approach offers **quick simulation modeling** but is **not synthesizable** and impractical in hardware.

Through this, I gained a deeper understanding of:

- FSM and datapath partitioning  
- Hardware implementation vs behavioral modeling  
- Trade-offs in algorithm selection based on speed and synthesizability
